## Project Overview
Swell Engine is a suite of UE5 assets that processes audio data into visual effects. Inspired by the expressiveness of titles like Rhythm Heaven Fever and Hi-Fi Rush, its core purpose is to enable developers who are pursuing audio-reactive simulations, whether for games, music videos, or another purpose.
